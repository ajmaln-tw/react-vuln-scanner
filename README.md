 TypeScript and JavaScript security scanner. The scanner can be used to scan both TypeScript and JavaScript code for vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerabilities scanned for**

The scanner scans for the following vulnerabilities:

- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection
- Command injection

**How to use the scanner**

To use the scanner, simply pass the JavaScript code you want to scan to the scanner function. The scanner will return a list of vulnerabilities found.

**Example**

```javascript
const scanner = require("./scanner");

const code = `
function login(username, password) {
  // ...
}
`;

const vulnerabilitiesFound = scanner(code);

if (vulnerabilitiesFound.length > 0) {
  // Handle vulnerabilities found.
}
```

`npx your-security-scanner scan [directory] [--type js|ts]`

**Testing the scanner**

To test the scanner, you can scan known vulnerable code and known clean code. If the scanner finds all of the vulnerabilities in the known vulnerable code and none of the vulnerabilities in the known clean code, then the scanner is working correctly.

**Keeping the scanner up to date**

New vulnerabilities are discovered all the time, so it is important to keep the scanner up to date with the latest information. You can do this by checking the scanner's GitHub repository for updates.

**Additional tips**

- Use the scanner on a regular basis to scan your JavaScript code for vulnerabilities.
- Remediate any vulnerabilities found as soon as possible.
- Keep the scanner up to date with the latest information.
